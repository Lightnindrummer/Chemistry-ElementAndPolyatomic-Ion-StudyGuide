# Chemistry: Element and Polyatomic Ion Study Guide(Total of 40 Elements 16 Ions) 

## Basic Workings 

A select amount of elements (customizable) within a total forty elements is randomly chosen, in which one half of the selected elements where only the name of the element is told and the other half only the symobl of the element is shown. There will also be a select amount (also customizable) of polyatomic ions within a total of 16 will also be randomly chose. Same as the elements, half of the selected ions will only the name of the ion is told and the other half only the formula. There will also be a time limit (customizable) with a minimum of 1 minute and a maximum of 10 minutes and 59 seconds.

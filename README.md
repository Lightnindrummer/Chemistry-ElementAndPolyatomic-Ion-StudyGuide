# Chemistry: Element and Polyatomic Ion Study Guide(Total of 40 Elements 16 Ions) 

## Basic Workings 

A select amount of elements (will be customizable) within the total forty elements is randomly chosen, in which one half of the selected elements where only the name of the element is told and the other half only the symobl of the element is shown. There will also be a select amount of polyatomic ion within the total of 16 will also be randomly chose. This time in one half of the selected ions where only the name of the ion is told and the other half only the formula is told.
